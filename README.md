# THE-COMPARATIVE-ANALYSIS-OF-DECISION-TREE-AND-K-NEAREST-NEIGHBOR-ALGORITHMS-
This repo evaluates the classification performance of both algorithms using key metrics  (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score) under different hyperparameter settings (KNN: k=3 vs.  k=5; Decision Trees: depth=3 vs. depth=5).
