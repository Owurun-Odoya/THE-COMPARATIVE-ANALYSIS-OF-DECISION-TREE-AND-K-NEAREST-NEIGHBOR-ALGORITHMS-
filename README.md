Machine learning algorithm selection is crucial for effective model deployment, therefore 
comparing different algorithms  performance across varying datasets is important. This report 
presents a comparative analysis of two fundamental machine learning algorithms; K-Nearest 
Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree, on the Iris and Breast Cancer datasets from the 
SciKit-learn library. The study evaluates their classification performance using key metrics 
(accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score) under different hyperparameter settings (KNN: k=3 vs. 
k=5; Decision Trees: depth=3 vs. depth=5). Results indicate that KNN performs optimally with 
fewer neighbors (k=3), achieving 95% accuracy on Breast Cancer and 100% on Iris, while 
Decision Trees benefit from increased depth (depth=5), improving Breast Cancer accuracy from 
89% to 91%.
